    <span>Welcome to the help page for Join, your guide to using our kanban project management tool. Here, we'll provide
        an overview of what Join is, how it can benefit you, and how to use it.</span>
    <h2>What is Join?</h2>
    <span>Join is a kanban-based project management tool designed and built by a group of dedicated students as part of
        their web development bootcamp at the Developer Akademie.<br><br>
        Kanban, a Japanese term meaning "billboard", is a highly effective method to visualize work, limit
        work-in-progress, and maximize efficiency (or flow). Join leverages the principles of kanban to help users
        manage their tasks and projects in an intuitive, visual interface.<br><br>
        It is important to note that Join is designed as an educational exercise and is not intended for extensive
        business usage. While we strive to ensure the best possible user experience, we cannot guarantee consistent
        availability, reliability, accuracy, or other aspects of quality regarding Join.</span>
    <h2>How to use it</h2>
    <span>Here is a step-by-step guide on how to use Join:</span>
    <div class="use-div">
        <div class="use-item">
            <h2>1.</h2>
            <div>
                <h3>Exploring the Board</h3>
                <span>When you log in to Join, you'll find a default board. This board represents your project and
                    contains four default lists: "To Do", "In Progress", “Await feedback” and "Done".</span>
            </div>
        </div>
        <div class="use-item">
            <h2>2.</h2>
            <div>
                <h3>Creating Contacts</h3>
                <span>In Join, you can add contacts to collaborate on your projects. Go to the "Contacts" section, click
                    on "New contact", and fill in the required information. Once added, these contacts can be assigned
                    tasks and they can interact with the tasks on the board.</span>
            </div>
        </div>
        <div class="use-item">
            <h2>3.</h2>
            <div>
                <h3>Adding Cards</h3>
                <span>Now that you've added your contacts, you can start adding cards. Cards represent individual tasks.
                    Click the "+" button under the appropriate list to create a new card. Fill in the task details in
                    the card, like task name, description, due date, assignees, etc.</span>
            </div>
        </div>
        <div class="use-item">
            <h2>4.</h2>
            <div>
                <h3>Moving Cards</h3>
                <span>As the task moves from one stage to another, you can reflect that on the board by dragging and
                    dropping the card from one list to another.</span>
            </div>
        </div>
        <div class="use-item">
            <h2>5.</h2>
            <div>
                <h3>Deleting Cards</h3>
                <span>Once a task is completed, you can either move it to the "Done" list or delete it. Deleting a card
                    will permanently remove it from the board. Please exercise caution when deleting cards, as this
                    action is irreversible.</span>
            </div>
        </div>
    </div>
    <span>Remember that using Join effectively requires consistent updates from you and your team to ensure the board
        reflects the current state of your project.<br><br></span>
